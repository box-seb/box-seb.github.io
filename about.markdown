This blog is mostly about my battles in the field of software engineering.
There are a few wins, a lot of scars and heaps of learning.
Software engineering is a social discipline and so the blog includes topics like technology, leadership, empathy.

The `Conceptual integrity` name comes from [The Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)
I like it because it tells a lot about software and generally leads toward simple solutions.
