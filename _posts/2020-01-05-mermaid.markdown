[Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/README) is a great tool to display diagrams.

To configure Mermaid for Jekyll is like adding dependency on JS library as presented [here](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/n00b-gettingStarted)

### Add JS library to `mermaid.html` file (or create it) in `_includes` folder as follows:
```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js"></script>
<script>mermaid.initialize({startOnLoad:true});</script>
```

### Update `head.html` in `_includes` folder by adding inclusion statement just above the `</head>` tag:
```
{% if page.mermaid %}
  {% include mermaid.html %}
{% endif %}
```

### Then include Mermaid in front matter on the page:
```

layout: post
title:  "Mermaid"
date:   2020-01-05
mermaid: true
---
```

### And add a script with `div` class `name=mermaid`:
```
<div class="this should be just mermaid">
flowchart LR
    A[COVID-19] --> B{lockdown?};
    B-- Yes -->C[Happy]
    B-- No -->D(Sad);
</div>
```

### The result is as below:
```
<div class="mermaid">
flowchart LR
    A[COVID-19] --> B{lockdown?};
    B-- Yes -->C[Happy]
    B-- No -->D(Sad);
</div>
```
