[Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/README) is a great tool to display diagrams.

To configure Mermaid for Jekyll is like adding dependency on JS library as presented [here](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/n00b-gettingStarted)

### Add JavaScript library
Create `mermaid.html` file in `_includes` folder as follows:

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js"></script>
<script>mermaid.initialize({startOnLoad:true});</script>
```

### Include added file
The example is for [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).
Update `custom-head.html` in `_includes` folder by adding inclusion statement at the bottom:

```
{% raw %}{% if page.mermaid %}
  {% include mermaid.html %}
{% endif %}{% endraw %}
```

### Use Mermaid
- Then include Mermaid in front matter on the page:

```

layout: post
title:  "Mermaid"
date:   2020-01-05
mermaid: true
---
```

- Add a script with `div` class `name=mermaid`:

```
<div class="mermaid">
flowchart LR
    A[coffee] --> B{tasty?};
    B-- Yes -->C[Happy]
    B-- No -->D(Sad);
</div>
```

### The result is as below:

<div class="mermaid">
flowchart LR
    A[coffee] --> B{tasty?};
    B-- Yes -->C[Happy]
    B-- No -->D(Sad);
</div>
