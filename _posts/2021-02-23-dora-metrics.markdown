## DORA metrics of delivery performance
DORA is  DevOps Research and Assessment team at Google Cloud. Four DORA metrics are:
- Deployment frequency - how often organization deploys code for a particular application or service.
- Lead time for changes - how much time it takes from committed to be running in production.
- Time to restore service - how much time it takes to restore the service when incident or defect impacts users.
- Change failure rate - what percentage of changes to production or released to users result in degraded service and subsequently require remediation.

### The four metrics are about throughput and stability
Throughput is measured by:
- Lead time for code changes
- Deployment frequency

Stability is measured by:
- Time to restore a service
- Change failure rate
